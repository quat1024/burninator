Dangerous Magma
===============

You know how you can sneak on magma blocks to avoid damage? Well, you can't do that anymore.

    [12:10 PM] carstorm: Anyone know of a mod that allows you to either disable sneaking outright, or to disable it when on certain blocks?
    [12:12 PM] gigaherz: Never heard of any such mod, or played on any modpack that did that :/
    [12:15 PM] carstorm: Shoot...I really need that feature for a pack I'm making as its a core mechanic...
