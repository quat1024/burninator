==========

Lets you make more blocks "hot", like magma blocks.

There's two modes of hot:

* "hot" blocks damage you always when you walk on them
* "semi-hot" blocks only damage you when you are not sneaking, like vanilla magma blocks

By default, this mod makes magma blocks "hot" instead of the vanilla default of "semi-hot".

Specify more resourcelocations in the config file.

    [12:10 PM] carstorm: Anyone know of a mod that allows you to either disable sneaking outright, or to disable it when on certain blocks?
    [12:12 PM] gigaherz: Never heard of any such mod, or played on any modpack that did that :/
    [12:15 PM] carstorm: Shoot...I really need that feature for a pack I'm making as its a core mechanic...
